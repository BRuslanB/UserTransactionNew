# User Transaction Service
This Java-based service is backed by a REST API for storing and processing expense transactions, as well as setting custom spending limits.
Note. This custom transaction service was created as a test task for an internship at one of the IT companies.

## Features
The User Transaction Service allows you to process two subtypes of services (banking and user):

1. Banking services:
* Receive and save transaction costs;
* Receive current exchange rates from an external resource;
* Convert the transaction amount to determine if the limit has been exceeded. The amount is converted at the current exchange rate and the type of currency of the established limit.
2. User services:
* Set a limit for subsequent transactions in the selected currency;
* Receive a list of all user limits;
* Receive a list of transactions that have exceeded the limit.

## Technologies Used

* Java 17
